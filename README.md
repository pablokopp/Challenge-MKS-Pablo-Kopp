# Challenge-MKS-Pablo-Kopp
Welcome to my challenge for entering Making Sense. I hope you enjoy the project as much as I did coding it.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Chart Js Library

## The challenge

The client has requested you to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible keeping in mind simplicity and ease-of-use.

Deliver the complete experience using HTML, CSS and JS. You can't use CSS frameworks/toolkits nor JS plugins, you can however use Sass if you like.

The Dashboard should display correctly in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. You'll only receive a desktop mockup. On mobile, the user should to be able to view as much information on the screen as posible, without losing the design's coherence. 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View more information about a specific social media account through a modal. For the chart the team has agreed on using the following library: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html
- Toggle color theme to their preference (optional)

On delivery, please provide clear explanations about your decision-making process for the responsive approach. Document code as much as possible as well.
